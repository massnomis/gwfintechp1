# Current Status 
# Lets make this a forum for status updates on subsections we're dealing with 

# Gas
# Sam and Yonathan decided to just make the fee a variable that'll be equal to 1 GWEI since standard on MATIC is always 1 GWEI
# We made this decision because there isn't an API that's collected previous gas prices, only way to actually use previous gas prices is if we tried to make a record from the data given for the MATIC Gas Station


# Monte Carlo Simulation(s)
# The style we're using isn't similar to our in-class examples so there's some issues currently 
# When I attempted to make a simulation, 'MCSimulation' wasn't named, and idek why it doesn't have this package


# Presenting the data
# Still working on making the x & y axis readable when plotting some of the data
